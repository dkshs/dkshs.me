Powered by [DKCutter](https://github.com/dkshs/dkcutter), DKCutter Django is a framework for jumpstarting production-ready Django projects quickly.

- If you have problems with DKCutter Django, please open [issues](https://github.com/dkshs/dkcutter-django/issues/new).

## Usage

To scaffold an application using [dkcutter](https://github.com/dkshs/dkcutter), run any of the following four commands and answer the command prompt questions:

### npm

```bash
npx dkcutter@latest gh:dkshs/dkcutter-django
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn dlx dkcutter@latest gh:dkshs/dkcutter-django
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm dlx dkcutter@latest gh:dkshs/dkcutter-django
```

### bun

```bash
bunx dkcutter@latest gh:dkshs/dkcutter-django
```

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you.

**Warning**: After this point, change 'DKSHS', etc to your own information.

Answer the prompts with your own desired [options][options-url]. For example:

```bash
# output
```

Enter the project and take a look around:

```bash
cd my-awesome-project/
ls
```

### Example

The following would be the structure of an application with Sentry:

```bash
pnpm dlx dkcutter gh:dkshs/dkcutter-django --additionalTools sentry
```

If you want to use all the default values with the exception of one or more, you can do it as follows:

```bash
pnpm dlx dkcutter gh:dkshs/dkcutter-django --additionalTools celery,sentry -y
```

This will use the default values except for `--additionalTools`.
